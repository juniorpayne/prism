- [ ] Get JWT tokens for API demos

### Test Run
- [ ] Test Alice's client starts successfully
- [ ] Test Bob's client starts successfully

- [ ] Start Bob's client
- [ ] Show both running simultaneously

### 6. User Isolation Demo (5 min)
- [ ] Alice's view:
  - [ ] Login as Alice
  - [ ] Show dashboard - only 1 host
  - [ ] Show hosts list - only alice-laptop
  - [ ] Try to access Bob's host ID - 404
- [ ] Bob's view:
  - [ ] Login as Bob
  - [ ] Show dashboard - only 1 host
  - [ ] Show hosts list - only bob-server
- [ ] Admin view:
  - [ ] Login as Admin
  - [ ] Show normal view first
  - [ ] Toggle "Show all users' hosts"
  - [ ] Show Owner column appears
  - [ ] Show system statistics

### 7. API Demonstration (3 min)
- [ ] Show Alice's API call - only her hosts
- [ ] Show Admin API call without ?all=true
- [ ] Show Admin API call with ?all=true
- [ ] Show statistics endpoint differences

### 8. Security Features (3 min)
- [ ] Token revocation demo
- [ ] Show invalid token behavior
- [ ] Show audit trail (last used)

### 9. Summary (2 min)
- [ ] Recap what was delivered
- [ ] Highlight business value
- [ ] Show completed user stories

### 10. Q&A (5 min)
- [ ] Be ready for common questions
- [ ] Have backup demos ready

## Troubleshooting

### If clients won't start:
- Check token is correct in YAML file
- Check server is running
- Check no old PIDs in /tmp
- Look at client logs

### If web UI issues:
- Clear browser cache
- Check browser console for errors
- Verify user is logged in
- Check JWT token hasn't expired

### If API calls fail:
- Verify JWT token is current
- Check authorization header format
- Ensure endpoints are correct
- Look at server logs

## Post-Demo
- [ ] Run cleanup script
- [ ] Stop all demo clients
- [ ] Save any feedback
- [ ] Note any bugs found
- [ ] Plan fixes if needed

## Backup Plans

### If live demo fails:
- Have screenshots ready
- Show the demo video (if recorded)
- Walk through code changes
- Focus on architecture/design

### Key files to have open:
- `/server/api/routes/hosts.py` (show filtering)
- `/server/auth/models.py` (show APIToken model)
- `/client/heartbeat_manager.py` (show auth_token usage)
- Web UI token management page

## Success Metrics
- [ ] Audience understands the problem solved
- [ ] Authentication flow is clear
- [ ] User isolation is demonstrated
- [ ] Security benefits are apparent
- [ ] Questions are answered satisfactorily
