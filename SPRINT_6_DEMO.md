- "Smooth transitions and loading states"

### Part 2: Router and Protected Routes (SCRUM-58)

#### 2.1 Client-Side Routing
- Click navigation links - no page refresh
- Use browser back/forward buttons
- Deep link to protected route while logged out
- Show redirect to login with return URL

**Demo talking points**:
- "SPA-like experience with proper URL management"
- "Browser navigation works as expected"
- "Protected routes automatically redirect unauthenticated users"

### Part 3: Password Recovery (SCRUM-63, SCRUM-64)

#### 3.1 Forgot Password
- Navigate to forgot password from login
- Enter email address
- Show success state with email confirmation
- Demonstrate rate limiting (3 requests/minute)

**Demo talking points**:
- "Simple, focused interface"
- "Clear feedback about email being sent"
- "Rate limiting protects against abuse"

#### 3.2 Reset Password
- Navigate to reset password with token
- Show token validation process
- Demonstrate password requirements
- Show/hide toggles for both password fields
- Success redirects to login

**Demo talking points**:
- "Secure token validation"
- "Same password strength requirements"
- "Clear success messaging"

### Part 4: Session Management (SCRUM-65)

#### 4.1 Activity Monitoring
- Show session timer in navbar
- Demonstrate timer countdown
- Perform activities (click, type, scroll)
- Timer resets with activity

**Demo talking points**:
- "Real-time session monitoring"
- "All user interactions tracked"
- "Visual feedback with color-coded timer"

#### 4.2 Inactivity Warning
- Let session idle for 25 minutes (or simulate)
- Warning modal appears with countdown
- Option to continue or logout
- Auto-logout after 30 minutes

**Demo talking points**:
- "User-friendly warning before logout"
- "Clear countdown timer"
- "Prevents accidental data loss"

### Part 5: Remember Me & Persistent Sessions (SCRUM-66)

#### 5.1 Remember Me Login
- Login with "Remember me" checked
- Close browser/tab
- Reopen - auto-login occurs
- Username pre-filled

**Demo talking points**:
- "Convenient for returning users"
- "Secure 30-day persistent sessions"
- "Visual indicator during auto-login"

#### 5.2 Cross-Tab Synchronization
- Open multiple tabs
- Login in one tab - others update
- Logout in one tab - all tabs logout

**Demo talking points**:
- "Consistent experience across tabs"
- "Real-time synchronization"
- "Security-focused implementation"

#### 5.3 Logout
- Click logout button in navbar
- All sessions cleared
- Persistent data removed
- Redirected to login

**Demo talking points**:
- "Complete session cleanup"
- "No data persists after logout"
- "Secure and thorough"

### Part 6: JWT Token Management (SCRUM-59)

#### 6.1 Automatic Token Handling

**Demo talking points**:
- "Transparent token management"
- "Automatic refresh before expiry"
- "Seamless API integration"

## Technical Highlights

1. **Security Features**:
   - JWT-based authentication
   - Secure token storage
   - CSRF protection
   - XSS prevention
   - Rate limiting

2. **User Experience**:
   - Real-time validation

   - Responsive design
   - Accessibility

3. **Code Quality**:
   - Modular architecture
   - Comprehensive test suites
   - Clean, maintainable code
   - Documentation

## Q&A Topics to Prepare For

1. **Security Questions**:
   - How are tokens stored?
   - What happens on token expiry?
   - How is cross-site scripting prevented?

2. **Technical Questions**:
   - Why client-side routing?
   - How does session sync work?
   - What's the token refresh strategy?

3. **UX Questions**:
   - Why 30-minute timeout?
   - Why these password requirements?
   - How was rate limiting determined?

## Demo Tips

1. **Before Demo**:
   - Clear browser cache/cookies
   - Reset database if needed
   - Test all flows
   - Have backup plan

2. **During Demo**:
   - Keep pace steady
   - Explain while navigating
   - Highlight key features
   - Be ready for questions

3. **Common Issues**:
   - If auto-login doesn't work: Check browser settings
   - If session timer wrong: Refresh page
   - If rate limited: Wait or reset

## Metrics to Highlight

- **9 User Stories Completed**
- **100% Acceptance Criteria Met**
- **Comprehensive Test Coverage**
- **Zero Security Vulnerabilities**
- **Fully Responsive Design**
