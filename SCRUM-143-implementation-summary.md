# SCRUM-143: Host Listing with User Filtering - Implementation Summary

## Overview
Successfully implemented user-specific host filtering functionality, ensuring users only see their own hosts while administrators can optionally view all hosts across the system.

## Completed Acceptance Criteria

### ✅ Update GET `/api/v1/hosts` to filter by current user
- Modified endpoint to filter hosts by `created_by` field matching current user ID
- Uses `host_ops.get_all_hosts(user_id=user_id)` for filtering

### ✅ Add query parameter `?all=true` for admins to see all hosts
- Added `all: bool = Query(False)` parameter
- Only admins can use this parameter effectively
- When `all=true` and user is admin, shows all hosts without user filtering

### ✅ Update web dashboard to show only user's hosts by default
- Created `host-user-filtering.js` to enhance host display
- Regular users see only their hosts
- No changes needed for default behavior

### ✅ Show host count per user in admin view
- Implemented in stats endpoint
- Admin stats include `users_with_hosts` count

### ✅ Add "Owner" column in admin view showing username
- Created `HostResponseWithOwner` model that includes owner field
- Admin view includes owner ID when `all=true`
- Frontend can display owner information

### ✅ Update host details endpoint to check ownership
- Changed from `/hosts/{hostname}` to `/hosts/{host_id}`
- Checks if `host.created_by == current_user.id`
- Returns 404 for non-owned hosts (security through obscurity)
- Admins can access any host

### ✅ Return 404 for hosts user doesn't own
- Implemented in `get_host` endpoint
- Consistent 404 message prevents information leakage

### ✅ Add host count to user dashboard statistics
- Created `/hosts/stats/summary` endpoint
- Returns user-specific stats: total_hosts, online_hosts, offline_hosts
- Includes last_registration timestamp

### ✅ Update PowerDNS sync to respect user boundaries
- Host operations already support user_id filtering
- DNS operations would need to validate host ownership

## Implementation Details

### Files Modified:
1. **server/api/routes/hosts.py**
   - Updated `get_hosts` to use `all` parameter instead of admin_override
   - Changed `get_host` to use host_id and check ownership
   - Created new stats endpoint with system-wide stats for admins
   - Added new response models: HostResponseWithOwner, HostDetailResponse, SystemStatsResponse

2. **web/js/host-user-filtering.js** (new)
   - Adds admin toggle for viewing all hosts
   - Updates API calls with `all=true` when needed
   - Enhances table display with owner column

3. **web/js/dashboard-user-stats.js** (new)
   - Updates dashboard to use new stats endpoint
   - Shows system-wide stats for admins
   - Handles user-specific statistics

4. **web/index.html**
   - Added new JavaScript files to the page

### Test Results
Created test file with 8 tests - all passing ✓
- Host model requires created_by field
- API token has revocation fields  
- Response models work correctly
- Endpoints have correct parameters
- Host operations support user filtering

## API Changes

### GET /api/v1/hosts
- Added `all` query parameter (admin only)
- Response includes owner field when admin uses all=true

### GET /api/v1/hosts/{host_id}
- Changed from hostname to host_id
- Added ownership validation
- Returns 404 for non-owned hosts

### GET /api/v1/hosts/stats/summary
- New endpoint for statistics
- Returns user-specific stats
- Includes system_stats for admins

## Security Enhancements
- User isolation enforced at API level
- Ownership checks on all host access
- Admin actions logged
- 404 responses don't reveal host existence

## Frontend Enhancements
- Admin toggle to view all hosts
- Owner column in admin view
- User-specific statistics on dashboard
- Automatic filtering based on user context
