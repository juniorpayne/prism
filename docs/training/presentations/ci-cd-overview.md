### Slide 3: What is CI/CD?

**Continuous Integration (CI)**
- Automated building and testing
- Early bug detection
- Consistent code quality

**Continuous Deployment (CD)**
- Automated deployment to production
- Reduced manual errors
- Faster time to market

### Slide 4: Why CI/CD Matters

| Traditional | CI/CD |
|------------|-------|
| Manual testing | Automated tests |
| Deployment scripts | Pipeline as code |
| Long release cycles | Frequent releases |
| High risk deploys | Incremental changes |
| Slow feedback | Instant feedback |

### Slide 5: Our Pipeline Architecture

    F --> G[Deploy Staging]
    G --> H[Smoke Tests]
    H --> I[Deploy Production]
    I --> J[Health Checks]
```

### Slide 6: Pipeline Stages

1. **Source** - Code repository
2. **Build** - Compile and package
3. **Test** - Unit, integration, security
4. **Deploy** - Environment deployment
5. **Monitor** - Health and metrics

### Slide 7: GitHub Actions Components

**Workflow**
```yaml
name: Deploy to Production
on:
  push:
    branches: [main]
```

**Jobs**
```yaml
jobs:
  build:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
  test:
    needs: build
  deploy:
    needs: test
```

**Steps**
```yaml
steps:
  - uses: actions/checkout@v4
  - name: Build application
    run: docker build .
```

### Slide 8: Our Deployment Workflow

```yaml
name: Deploy to EC2
on:
  push:
    branches: [main]
  workflow_dispatch:

jobs:
  deploy:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - name: Checkout code
        uses: actions/checkout@v4
      
      - name: Build and test
        run: |
          docker-compose build
          docker-compose run tests
      
      - name: Deploy to EC2
        uses: appleboy/ssh-action@v1.0.0
        with:
          host: ${{ secrets.EC2_HOST }}
          username: ubuntu
          key: ${{ secrets.EC2_SSH_KEY }}
          script: |
            cd ~/prism-deployment
            docker-compose pull
            docker-compose up -d
```

### Slide 9: Environment Strategy

| Environment | Trigger | Approval | Purpose |
|------------|---------|----------|---------|
| Development | PR | Auto | Testing |
| Staging | main push | Auto | Integration |
| Production | Manual | Required | Live service |

### Slide 10: Security in CI/CD

**Secret Management**
- GitHub Secrets for credentials
- Environment-specific configs
- Automatic rotation

**Scanning**
- Container vulnerability scan
- Dependency checks
- SAST/DAST integration

### Slide 11: Deployment Process

1. **Developer commits code**
   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "feat: new feature"
   git push origin main
   ```

2. **GitHub Actions triggered**
   - Builds Docker images
   - Runs test suite
   - Scans for vulnerabilities

3. **Deployment execution**
   - SSH to EC2
   - Pull new images
   - Rolling update

### Slide 12: Live Demo Script

```bash
# Make a change
echo "# New feature" >> README.md
git add README.md
git commit -m "docs: add new feature"
git push origin main

# Watch GitHub Actions
# Show running workflow
# Show deployment logs
# Verify deployment
```

### Slide 13: Monitoring Integration

**Metrics Collection**
- Build success rate
- Deployment frequency
- Lead time for changes
- Mean time to recovery

**Dashboards**
- GitHub Actions insights
- Grafana deployment metrics
- Application health status

### Slide 14: Rollback Procedures

**Automatic Rollback**
```yaml
- name: Health Check
  run: |
    if ! curl -f https://app.example.com/health; then
      echo "Health check failed, rolling back"
      ./scripts/rollback.sh
    fi
```

**Manual Rollback**
```bash
# List deployments
./scripts/list-deployments.sh

# Rollback to previous
./scripts/rollback.sh v1.2.3
```

### Slide 15: Best Practices

1. **Keep builds fast** (<10 minutes)
2. **Test in parallel** when possible
3. **Use caching** for dependencies
4. **Fail fast** on errors
5. **Monitor everything**
6. **Document runbooks**

### Slide 16: Common Pitfalls

❌ **Avoid These:**
- Hardcoded secrets
- Skipping tests for speed
- Large, infrequent deploys
- No rollback plan
- Ignoring alerts

✅ **Do These Instead:**
- Use secret management
- Comprehensive test suite
- Small, frequent deploys
- Automated rollbacks
- Alert response SLAs
