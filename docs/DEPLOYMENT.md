# Deployment Documentation

This document describes the automated deployment process for the Prism DNS project using GitHub Actions and EC2.

> **PowerDNS Deployment**: For instructions on deploying the PowerDNS DNS server component, see [POWERDNS_DEPLOYMENT.md](./POWERDNS_DEPLOYMENT.md)

## Quick Start - Production Deployment

### Prerequisites
- SSH access to production server
- `.env.production` file configured (see `.env.production.example`)
- Docker and Docker Compose installed on server

### Deployment Steps
```bash
# Connect to production server
ssh -i citadel.pem ubuntu@35.170.180.10

# Navigate to deployment directory
cd /home/ubuntu/prism-deployment

# Deploy using the unified compose file
docker compose -f docker-compose.production.yml up -d

# Verify deployment
docker compose -f docker-compose.production.yml ps
curl http://localhost:8081/api/health
curl http://localhost:8081/api/dns/health
```

## Docker Compose Structure

### Simplified Structure (As of July 2025)
- **docker-compose.yml** - Development environment (use with `--profile with-powerdns`)
- **docker-compose.production.yml** - Production environment (includes all services)
- **ARCHIVED: docker-compose.test.yml** - DO NOT USE (moved to archive/)

### Service Configuration
All services run on a single `prism-network` bridge network to ensure proper communication:
- prism-server (main application)
- prism-nginx (web interface)
- powerdns-server (DNS server)
- powerdns-database (PostgreSQL for PowerDNS)

## Overview

The deployment system provides automated, reliable deployments to multiple environments with health checks, rollback capabilities, and comprehensive monitoring.

## Deployment Environments

### Development Environment
- **Trigger**: Automatic on push to `develop` branch
- **Target**: EC2 instance (35.170.180.10)
- **Approval**: None required
- **Database**: Test data, migrations allowed
- **Monitoring**: Basic health checks

### Staging Environment
- **Trigger**: Automatic on push to `main` branch
- **Target**: EC2 instance (35.170.180.10)
- **Approval**: None required
- **Database**: Production-like data, migration testing
- **Monitoring**: Full monitoring suite

### Production Environment
- **Trigger**: Manual trigger with approval required
- **Target**: EC2 instance (35.170.180.10)
- **Approval**: Required from authorized team members
- **Database**: Live data, careful migration handling
- **Monitoring**: Full monitoring with alerting

## Deployment Workflow

### Automatic Deployment
Deployments are automatically triggered when:
1. CI Pipeline completes successfully on `main` or `develop` branches
2. Container images are built and pushed to registry
3. All tests pass and quality gates are met

### Manual Deployment
Deployments can be manually triggered via GitHub Actions:
1. Go to Actions ‚Üí Deploy to EC2
2. Click "Run workflow"
3. Select environment and image tag
4. For production, approval is required

## Deployment Process

### 1. Pre-deployment Checks
- ‚úÖ Verify container images exist in registry
- ‚úÖ Test SSH connection to EC2 instance  
- ‚úÖ Check current deployment health
- ‚úÖ Create backup of current deployment

### 2. Deployment Execution
- üì¶ Create deployment package
- üì§ Upload to EC2 instance
- üíæ Backup current configuration
- üîÑ Perform rolling deployment
- üè• Run health checks
- üí® Execute smoke tests

### 3. Post-deployment
- ‚úÖ Comprehensive health verification
- üìä Generate deployment summary
- üßπ Cleanup deployment artifacts
- üìß Send notifications (if configured)

### 4. Rollback (if needed)
- üîÑ Automatic rollback on failure
- üíæ Restore from backup
- üè• Verify service restoration

## Container Images

All deployments use container images from GitHub Container Registry (ghcr.io):

- **Server**: `ghcr.io/[owner]/prism-server:latest`
- **Web**: `ghcr.io/[owner]/prism-web:latest`
- **Database**: `postgres:15-alpine`

## Health Checks

### Container Health
- All containers (prism-server, prism-nginx, prism-database) must be running
- Container logs checked for recent errors
- Resource usage monitoring

### Service Health
- **Web Interface**: HTTP GET to `http://localhost/`
- **API Health**: HTTP GET to `http://localhost/api/health`
- **TCP Server**: TCP connection to `localhost:8080`
- **Database**: PostgreSQL connectivity check

### System Health
- Disk space utilization
- Memory usage monitoring
- Network connectivity verification

## Smoke Tests

Automated tests run after deployment:

1. **Web Interface Content**: Verify expected content is served
2. **API Structure**: Verify health endpoint returns proper JSON
3. **TCP Connectivity**: Test DNS server accepts connections
4. **Database Connection**: Verify database is accessible
5. **File Permissions**: Check container file system access

## Rollback Procedures

### Automatic Rollback
- Triggered automatically if deployment health checks fail
- Restores previous docker-compose configuration
- Restarts services with previous images
- Verifies service restoration

### Manual Rollback
```bash
# Connect to EC2 instance
ssh -i citadel.pem ubuntu@35.170.180.10

# List available backups
ls -la ~/deployment-backups/

# Choose backup to restore from
BACKUP_NAME="20240106-143022-1234567"
cd ~/managedDns

# Stop current services
docker-compose down

# Restore configuration
cp ~/deployment-backups/$BACKUP_NAME/docker-compose.* .

# Restart services
docker-compose -f docker-compose.production.yml up -d

# Verify restoration
curl http://localhost/api/health
```

## Environment Configuration

## Security

### SSH Security
- SSH keys managed in GitHub secrets
- Host key verification enabled
- Non-interactive deployment execution
- Secure key file handling

### Container Security
- Images scanned for vulnerabilities
- Security patches applied automatically
- Principle of least privilege
- Network isolation where possible

### Data Security
- Database passwords encrypted
- No sensitive data in logs
- Audit trail for all deployments
- Secure backup storage

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

#### Deployment Fails with SSH Connection Error
```bash
# Check SSH key is correctly set in GitHub secrets
# Verify EC2 instance is running and accessible
# Check security groups allow SSH access
ssh -i citadel.pem ubuntu@35.170.180.10 echo "Connection test"
```

#### Health Checks Fail After Deployment
```bash
# Check container status
docker ps --filter "name=prism-"

# Check container logs
docker logs prism-server
docker logs prism-nginx

# Check service endpoints manually
curl -v http://localhost/
curl -v http://localhost/api/health
nc -v localhost 8080
```

#### Images Not Found in Registry
```bash
# Verify CI pipeline completed successfully
# Check container registry for images
# Verify image tag exists
docker manifest inspect ghcr.io/[owner]/prism-server:latest
```

#### Rollback Fails
```bash
# Check backup directory exists
ls -la ~/deployment-backups/

# Manually restore configuration
cp ~/deployment-backups/latest/docker-compose.production.yml ~/managedDns/

# Restart services manually
cd ~/managedDns
docker-compose down
docker-compose -f docker-compose.production.yml up -d
```
