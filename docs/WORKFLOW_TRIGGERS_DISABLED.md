# GitHub Workflow Automatic Triggers Disabled

## Summary
As requested, I've disabled automatic triggers for workflows that were running unnecessarily on push to main branch. These workflows can still be run manually if needed.

## Workflows Modified

### 1. deploy-webhook.yml
- **What changed**: Disabled automatic trigger on push to main
- **Why**: This workflow was failing due to missing Docker Hub credentials and webhook configuration
- **Current state**: Can only be triggered manually via workflow_dispatch

### 2. deploy-environments.yml  
- **What changed**: Disabled automatic triggers on push to main and develop branches
- **Why**: Not using this complex environment-based deployment system
- **Current state**: Can only be triggered manually via workflow_dispatch

### 3. deploy.yml
- **What changed**: Disabled automatic trigger after CI Pipeline completion
- **Why**: Not using this registry-based deployment approach
- **Current state**: Can only be triggered manually via workflow_dispatch

### 4. cleanup-images.yml
- **What changed**: Disabled weekly scheduled cleanup
- **Why**: Not using container registry, so no images to clean up
- **Current state**: Can only be triggered manually via workflow_dispatch

## Workflows Still Active

These workflows still have their automatic triggers enabled as they are useful:

1. **ci.yml** - Runs on push to main/develop and on PRs (important for code quality)
2. **pr-check.yml** - Runs on pull requests (quick validation)
3. **build-and-publish.yml** - Still triggers on push but doesn't affect deployments

## Your Primary Workflow

**deploy-direct.yml** remains unchanged - it's manual-only (workflow_dispatch) and is the workflow you actually use for deployments.

## Benefits

1. No more failing webhook deployment notifications
2. No conflicting deployment attempts when pushing to main
3. Cleaner GitHub Actions history
4. Manual control over when deployments happen
5. All workflows can still be run manually if needed in the future

## To Re-enable

If you ever want to re-enable automatic triggers, simply uncomment the trigger sections in the respective workflow files.
