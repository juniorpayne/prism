# UI EPIC Summary: Multi-Tenant Web Interface (SCRUM-57)

## Overview

I've created a comprehensive EPIC for the Multi-Tenant Web Interface that complements the existing backend authentication system. This EPIC is designed to provide a complete user experience for DNS management with a focus on:

1. **Authentication UI** - Login, registration, password reset
2. **Account Management** - User profile, settings, API keys
3. **DNS Zone Management (Stub)** - Basic UI for future DNS functionality
4. **Dynamic DNS Client Management** - Managing Prism clients

## Key Design Decisions

### 1. Progressive Enhancement
- Start with core authentication features
- Build on existing Bootstrap-based UI
- Maintain backward compatibility with existing dashboard

### 2. Technology Choices
- **Vanilla JavaScript**: No heavy frameworks for the prototype
- **Bootstrap 5**: Already in use, provides responsive design
- **Client-side routing**: Single-page application experience
- **JWT handling**: Secure token management with auto-refresh

### 3. User Experience
- **Mobile-first**: All interfaces work on mobile devices
- **Accessibility**: WCAG 2.1 AA compliance
- **Performance**: Fast loading, minimal bundle size
- **Security**: Proper token handling, XSS prevention

## EPIC Structure

### Total Scope: 124 Story Points across 7 Sprints

1. **Sprint 1: Authentication Foundation (21 points)**
   - Router with protected routes
   - JWT token management
   - Login and registration pages
   - Email verification flow

2. **Sprint 2: Password Reset & Sessions (14 points)**
   - Forgot/reset password UI
   - Session management
   - Remember me functionality

3. **Sprint 3: Account Management (20 points)**
   - User profile page
   - Account settings
   - Organization display
   - API key management

4. **Sprint 4: Navigation & Layout (16 points)**
   - Authenticated app layout
   - Dashboard redesign
   - Navigation improvements

5. **Sprint 5: DNS Zone Stub (16 points)**
   - Zone list and management UI
   - DNS records display (read-only)

6. **Sprint 6: Client Management (20 points)**
   - Dynamic DNS client list
   - Token generation
   - Configuration download
   - Health monitoring

7. **Sprint 7: Polish & Testing (17 points)**
   - Loading states
   - Error handling
   - Form validation
   - Notifications

## Example User Stories Created

I've created three detailed user stories as examples of the level of detail needed:

### 1. SCRUM-58: Frontend Router and Protected Routes (5 points)
- Complete routing implementation
- Protected route guards
- Redirect after login functionality
- Browser navigation support

### 2. SCRUM-59: JWT Token Management (5 points)
- Token storage and retrieval
- Automatic refresh before expiry
- 401 response handling
- API client integration

### 3. SCRUM-60: Login Page UI (3 points)
- Complete UI implementation
- Form validation
- Error handling
- Accessibility features

## Key Features of User Stories

Each story includes:
- **Clear acceptance criteria** with checkboxes
- **Technical implementation** with code examples
- **Files to create/modify** with paths
- **Testing requirements** 
- **Security considerations**
- **Accessibility requirements**
- **Definition of Done** checklist

## Benefits of This Approach

1. **Detailed enough for any developer** - Stories contain implementation details
2. **Consistent with existing code** - Builds on current architecture
3. **Security-first** - Token handling and XSS prevention built in
4. **Accessible by design** - WCAG compliance from the start
5. **Performance focused** - Lightweight implementation
6. **Test-driven** - Clear testing requirements

## Next Steps

1. Review and approve the EPIC structure
2. Create remaining user stories for Sprint 1
3. Estimate and plan Sprint 1 implementation
4. Begin development with SCRUM-58 (Router)

## Integration Points

The UI will integrate with:
- **Backend Auth API** (already complete)
- **Existing web interface** (Dashboard, Hosts)
- **Future DNS management API**
- **Dynamic DNS client API**

## Success Metrics

- User registration completion > 80%
- Login success rate > 95%
- Page load time < 3 seconds
- Zero critical accessibility issues
- User satisfaction > 4.5/5

This EPIC provides a solid foundation for building a modern, secure, and user-friendly interface for the multi-tenant DNS service.
