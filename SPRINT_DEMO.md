# Sprint Demo: Multi-Tenant Authentication Implementation

## Overview
This sprint focused on implementing the authentication foundation for transforming Prism DNS into a multi-tenant managed DNS service. We completed user registration, email verification, and JWT authentication.

## Completed User Stories

### SCRUM-53: User Registration and Email Verification ✅
- **Status**: Completed and in production
- **Key Features**:
  - User registration with email/username/password
  - Email verification with 24-hour expiry tokens
  - Automatic organization creation on verification
  - Password complexity requirements (12+ chars)
  - Rate limiting (5 registrations per hour)

### SCRUM-54: JWT Authentication for API ✅
- **Status**: Completed and waiting for review
- **Key Features**:
  - JWT-based authentication with access/refresh tokens
  - Access tokens expire in 15 minutes
  - Refresh tokens expire in 7 days
  - Secure token storage and revocation
  - Protected endpoint authentication

## Live Demo Walkthrough

### 1. API Documentation
Navigate to: http://localhost:8081/api/docs

**Authentication Endpoints Available:**
- POST /api/auth/register - Register new user
- GET /api/auth/verify-email/{token} - Verify email
- POST /api/auth/login - Login with JWT
- POST /api/auth/refresh - Refresh access token
- POST /api/auth/logout - Logout
- GET /api/auth/me - Get current user

### 2. User Registration Flow

```bash
# Register a new user
curl -X POST http://localhost:8081/api/auth/register \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "email": "demo@example.com",
    "username": "demouser",
    "password": "SecurePassword123!"
  }'

# Response:
{
  "user": {
    "id": "uuid-here",
    "email": "demo@example.com",
    "username": "demouser",
    "email_verified": false,
    "is_active": true,
    "created_at": "2025-06-13T12:00:00"
  },
  "message": "Registration successful. Please check your email to verify your account."
}
```

### 3. Email Verification
In production, an email is sent. For demo, check server logs for verification link:
```
Verification URL: http://localhost:8081/api/auth/verify-email/{token}
```

### 4. JWT Authentication Flow

```bash
# Login to get JWT tokens
curl -X POST http://localhost:8081/api/auth/login \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "username": "demouser",
    "password": "SecurePassword123!"
  }'

# Response:
{
  "access_token": "eyJ...",
  "refresh_token": "eyJ...",
  "token_type": "Bearer",
  "expires_in": 900
}

# Use access token to access protected endpoint
curl -X GET http://localhost:8081/api/auth/me \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer eyJ..."

# Response:
{
  "id": "uuid-here",
  "email": "demo@example.com",
  "username": "demouser",
  "email_verified": true,
  "is_active": true,
  "created_at": "2025-06-13T12:00:00"
}
```

### 5. Token Refresh Flow

```bash
# Refresh access token
curl -X POST http://localhost:8081/api/auth/refresh \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "refresh_token": "eyJ..."
  }'

# Response:
{
  "access_token": "eyJ...",
  "token_type": "Bearer",
  "expires_in": 900
}
```

### 6. Logout

```bash
# Logout and revoke tokens
curl -X POST http://localhost:8081/api/auth/logout \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer eyJ..."

# Response:
{
  "message": "Logged out successfully"
}
```

## Technical Achievements

### Database Schema
- Added user authentication tables
- Organization and membership models
- Email verification tokens
- JWT refresh token storage

### Security Implementation
- Bcrypt password hashing
- JWT token management
- Rate limiting on auth endpoints
- Email verification requirement
- Token blacklisting capability

### Testing Coverage
- 24 authentication tests total
- 11 registration tests
- 13 JWT authentication tests
- All tests passing in Docker

### Infrastructure Improvements
- Added nginx to development for production parity
- Pre-deployment testing script
- Git pre-push hooks for safety
- Docker-based test environment

## Metrics

- **Code Quality**: 100% linting compliance (Black, isort, flake8)
- **Test Coverage**: All authentication flows tested
- **Documentation**: API docs auto-generated with FastAPI
- **Security**: Industry-standard authentication practices

## Next Steps

### SCRUM-55: Password Reset Flow (Next Sprint)
- Implement forgot password endpoint
- Email-based password reset tokens
- Secure password update process

### Future Enhancements
- Two-factor authentication (2FA)
- OAuth2/OIDC integration
- API key management
- Session management

```

## Questions?

This completes the authentication foundation for the multi-tenant DNS service. The system is now ready for users to register, verify their email, and authenticate using JWT tokens.
