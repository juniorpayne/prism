# Sprint Demo Summary: Authentication Features

## Overview
We have successfully implemented all three user stories in the authentication sprint for the Multi-Tenant Managed DNS Service (SCRUM-52).

## Features Demonstrated

### 1. SCRUM-53: User Registration & Email Verification ✅
- **Endpoint**: `POST /api/auth/register`
- **Features**:
  - User registration with email and username
  - Password complexity validation (12+ chars, uppercase, lowercase, digit, special)
  - Email verification required before login
  - Rate limiting: 5 registrations per hour
  - Secure token generation for email verification

### 2. SCRUM-54: JWT Authentication ✅
- **Endpoints**:
  - `POST /api/auth/login` - Login with username/email and password
  - `GET /api/auth/me` - Get current user (protected)
  - `POST /api/auth/refresh` - Refresh access token
  - `POST /api/auth/logout` - Logout and revoke tokens
- **Features**:
  - JWT-based authentication
  - Short-lived access tokens (15 minutes)
  - Long-lived refresh tokens (7 days)
  - Secure token storage with hashing
  - Session tracking and revocation
  - Support for multiple sessions

### 3. SCRUM-55: Password Reset Flow ✅
- **Endpoints**:
  - `POST /api/auth/forgot-password` - Request password reset
  - `POST /api/auth/reset-password` - Reset password with token
- **Features**:
  - Secure token-based password reset
  - Prevents user enumeration (same response for all requests)
  - Token expiration (1 hour)
  - One-time use tokens
  - Rate limiting: 3 requests per hour
  - All sessions invalidated after password reset
  - Email notifications with security information

## Security Features Implemented

### Authentication Security
- ✅ Email verification required
- ✅ Password complexity requirements
- ✅ Secure password hashing (bcrypt)
- ✅ JWT tokens with proper expiration
- ✅ Refresh token rotation
- ✅ Session tracking and revocation

### API Security
- ✅ Rate limiting on sensitive endpoints
- ✅ CORS configuration
- ✅ Input validation with Pydantic
- ✅ SQL injection prevention (SQLAlchemy ORM)
- ✅ Enumeration attack prevention

### Password Reset Security
- ✅ Secure token generation
- ✅ Token hashing in database
- ✅ One-time use enforcement
- ✅ Time-based expiration
- ✅ Session invalidation on reset

## Test Coverage
- **36 Total Tests**:
  - 11 Registration tests ✅
  - 13 JWT authentication tests ✅
  - 12 Password reset tests ✅
- All tests passing (some may show rate limit errors during demo due to multiple runs)

## API Documentation
- Interactive documentation: http://localhost:8081/docs
- OpenAPI schema: http://localhost:8081/openapi.json
- All endpoints fully documented with:
  - Request/response schemas
  - Authentication requirements
  - Rate limiting information
  - Error responses

## Code Quality
- ✅ Black formatting applied
- ✅ Import sorting with isort
- ✅ Flake8 linting passed
- ✅ Type hints throughout
- ✅ Comprehensive error handling

## Database Schema
- Users table with secure password storage
- Email verification tokens table
- Password reset tokens table
- Refresh tokens table for session management
- Organizations and user_organizations for multi-tenancy (ready for next sprint)

## Next Steps
1. All three user stories moved to "Waiting for Review" in Jira
2. Code committed and pushed to GitHub
3. CI/CD pipeline will automatically deploy to production upon merge
4. Ready for code review and sprint retrospective

## Demo Commands
```bash
# Start services
docker compose up -d

# Run API demo
python3 api_demo.py

# Run tests
docker compose exec server pytest tests/test_auth -v

# Access API documentation
open http://localhost:8081/docs
```

## Conclusion
The authentication sprint has been successfully completed with all features implemented, tested, and ready for production deployment. The implementation follows security best practices and provides a solid foundation for the multi-tenant DNS management system.
