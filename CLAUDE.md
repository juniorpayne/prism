# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Overview

This is the "prism" project - a managed DNS solution. The repository is currently in its initial state with minimal structure.

## Development Status

This appears to be a newly initialized repository with only a basic README.md file. The project structure and build system have not yet been established.

## Getting Started

Since this is a new project, you may need to:
- Determine the technology stack and framework
- Set up the build system and project structure
- Initialize package management and dependencies
- Establish development workflows and testing frameworks

## Current State

- Repository contains only a README.md with project name "prism"
- No build scripts, package managers, or development tools configured yet
- No existing codebase or documentation to reference
