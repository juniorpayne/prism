## Jira Workflow Notes

- When updating a Jira issue using jira:update_issue you need to use ADF (Atlassian Document Format), But not when createing new issues, ONLY when updating issues.
- After you finish reviewing a jira ticket and it has passed its review you need to change the status to done.
- Jira workflow: todo -> in progress -> waiting for review -> in review -> done
- Always update the status of jira issues when your work affects it.
- **Always update the jira issue status for the current issue you are working on.**
